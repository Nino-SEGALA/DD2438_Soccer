# DD2438_Soccer

In this project, I created and implemented a strategy for a 3v3 Soccer game.

The two main files containing my work are (in Assets/Scrips):
1. Soccer.BT.txt
2. DroneAIBTSoccer_blue.cs

In the first one, the Behaviour Tree corresponding to the strategy can be founded. I was inspired by strategies from the e-sport game 
Rocket League to create a rotation between the 3 players of my team.

In the second one, all the functions needed to implement the strategy are defined.

I finished second out of 15 teams.  
A complete report *DD2438_Assignment3_group10* of this report can also be found.
